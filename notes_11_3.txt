(1) Tau_k try more extreme case
	- try volumes 10,000
	- seed 5 alpha 25 lambda 0.5 
	- compare with paired bar graph to truth
		- Order by the true value highest to lowest and pair with estimate to compare trend
		- repeat 10-100 times and average to see 
	
(2) Alpha/lambda
	- Grid search alpha, given tau_k est, and opt w.r.t. lambda pick best pair
		- then fix alpha and sample lambda
	- Check end results distributions of tau_k vs. truth 

11/8 Update  

(1) Tau_k trend
	- Diagnose the issue and get it to look like a similar trend

(2) Alpha/lambda
	- Grid search for mean, optimize w.r.t. lambda
	- Take e-bayes estimator for alpha_tau based on the optimization above
	- Fix alpha_tau and sample lambda_2
	- Check tau_k & lambda_2 joint sample (once tau_k is sorted)
